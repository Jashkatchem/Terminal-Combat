Hello and welcome to TERMINAL COMBAT!

The game is a simulaiton of a sparring match between two FIGHTERS.
Both of you will begin the fight with 100 STAMINA and lose it as the FIGHT
progresses. 

You lose STAMINA for being hit and will lose some as the FIGHT goes on.
No one can JUMP and DUCK forever. 

THe first FIGHTER to run out of STAMINA loses. 

Each ROUND you will pick an OFFENSIVE MOVE and a DEFENSIVE MOVE.

DUCKING dodges PUNCHING and JUMPING dodges KICKING

Sometimes when your HIT connects you will strike your opponent particularly hard. 
This is called a CRITICAL HIT. 

Good luck and have fun!
